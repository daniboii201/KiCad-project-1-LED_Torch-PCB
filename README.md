# KiCad project #1: LED Torch PCB
• This is my first PCB design created using KiCad. It’s a beginner-friendly project featuring a very simple circuit: an LED, a resistor, a push button, and a CR2032 battery holder.

## Features
### Components:
• LED

• Resistor

• Push Button

• CR2032 Battery Holder

### Tools Used:

• KiCad for schematic and PCB layout

## Why This Project?

• This LED torch was a great starting point for learning PCB design fundamentals, including schematic capture, footprint assignment, and routing.

## Repository Contents

• KiCad project files (.sch, .kicad_pcb)

• Schematic diagram

• PCB layout
